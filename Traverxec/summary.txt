Traverxec is a Linux-based target machine, which opens the common 22 and 80 ports.  
There is nothing to use for websites running on port 80,  
but the middleware service nostromo 1.9.6 of the website has a directory to bypass and cause code execution.  
After entering the target with www-data permissions, the /home/david directory was found to be unreachable.  
However, looking at the nostromo documentation, I found that the configuration file has a HOMEDIRS option,  
where the homedirs_public attribute specifies the home directory of the website,  
and found that /home/david/pulic_www/ is reachable, which contains david's private key.  
I checked Google and found a script in the /home/david/bin directory, and /usr/bin/journalctl was run as root.  
Looking at GTFObins, I found that journalctl running through sudo can be used to escalate privileges.  
Shrink the window and trigger the pager to gain root privileges.
